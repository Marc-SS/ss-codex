Since we are creating new website for new clients, so all initial request should come from PM first. 
1. Pm will assign Setup #1 - #6 tickets to Setup Team, and we need to QA all the tickets. Check on SS Hub Documentation on step by step QAing setup ticket.

2. Once Setup done, PM will assign Design tickets to designer (front-end developer), and we need to QA the design as per client requirements.

3. Once the design ticket done, QA will received full test ticket.  Check on SS Hub Documentation for elements need to be checked on website.

4. After all done, PM will show the demo site to clients, and if client wish to have further adjustments, tickets will be sent to developer / designer that QA need to check later one. 

5. This cycle will occur until PM stated that the site is ready to launch.

6. There will be different checklist for launch websites.

C. Understand the Zoo System 
Zoo system is quite complicated, but new QA should know that property listings appear in our website come from Zoo. 
Please ask your manager to give short introduction to zoo, and then you can learn from time to time.
